The higher level of comfort knowing that the security used is a class of it's own. However, this experience can go a long way if the bank were to offer more service and integrate it into the app.\n",

Now when I'm trying to convert it to savings account for months, it shows the same error every time.

It is almost impossible to get in touch with support for issues other than the predefined FAQ. Unable to complete MF KYC and no option to contact support or report the issue. Update - 16 Feb 2019 After using more than a year and frequent updates issues have been resolved and the app works without any issues. Keep up the good work team.\n",

ATM card was sent to my address within 7 days of accout activation. For the biometric verification their representative will visit the address which you fill in online form while opening the account. I have opened a RD account and this bank is giving me 7.5% interest also. I also got Rs 500 as cashback for two successful referrals. Thank you DBS.\n",

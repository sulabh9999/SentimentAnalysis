Support is more important since you deal with money of people. UI is okay, but Digibank has NO PROPER SUPPORT SYSTEM. The only option is CHAT via agent, which is buggy. If I'm in chat with an agent, the app thinks I'm not active and hence logs me out due to inactivity. THIS IS A HUGE BUG. Even when I'm in ACTIVE talk to an agent for some support, the app logs me out due to inactivity, and I cannot continue that same chat, or contact that same agent again. I've to repeat whole process from start with a new agent. There is NO option of telephonic support either. You've to rely on that buggy chat support.\n",

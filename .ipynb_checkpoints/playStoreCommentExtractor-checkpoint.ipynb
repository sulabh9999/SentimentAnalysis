The higher level of comfort knowing that the security used is a class of it's own. However, this experience can go a long way if the bank were to offer more service and integrate it into the app.\n",

After entering the otp correctly it says linking device... device linking failed and then I'm logged out. I had opened by dbs wallet last year on my same phone. Now when I'm trying to convert it to savings account for months, it shows the same error every time. I cant even create a fresh account on my phone as it shows the error that this devive is already linked with another account.\n",
